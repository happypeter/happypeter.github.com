My friend,

I am writing to comment on your <http://kanasshop.com/>. You are doing quite well
I think by making this site pretty. But here I want to give my opinion on how
we can add more beauty and reduce its unnecessary complexity. 

I take <http://www.apple.com/> as a example for good style.

### Logo

I am not with you to choose _Tux_ as logo for your shop, it is simply not
distinguishable enough from the standard tux logo.  You have a character _Tao_
on that, but for me that is not related to your product. As a customer, all I
want from a site is the info of the products and services. And I will be
most satisfied if I experience the most in beauty and the least in complexity
while getting all the info I want.  If a site fail to do that, it will lose my
love in the first 5 or 10 seconds.  All in all, do not push content unrelated
because of your personal taste, this is also for your slogan _ZiQiangBuXi_.

A logo shall be unique, simple and preferably somewhat related to your
product. For me I need a logo suitable for different colors, cause one day I
may want to change the css of this site and have another color scheme.  The
logos of apple and ubuntu are good.

### Details

You have not add your logo to your `<head><title>`, that is detail of cause,
but _Demo Lives In Details_, the absence of this will be considered
unprofessional in the picky eyes of your potential customers.

Some of your pics have dark bar on the right, that does not look good, better
to remove them with GIMP.

### English Version

Nice to have a English Version of your stuff, I believe.

### Get Feedbacks

Be it a forum or a comment area, have some place for people to comment on your ideas.
[Github](http://www.github.com) founder once said on his own
[site](http://tom.preston-werner.com/), (I forget which post these words are
on), that he had long been posting his ideas on web, and the feedbacks turned
out to be invaluable.

### Free Trial

Thinking about _Github.com_, I think their service module is partly the reason
for their rapid taking-off. It is that they let you to have a free trial of
their services, later you find these nice, you are apt to pay. So, if
possible, provide sth free, show people why _Open Source_ can be so much fun
on _kanasshop.com_ , maybe we won't get money, we will get least get fame, and
thus more social connections.

### Misc

I found sth [here](http://www.wordsinarow.com/design.html):

- Your website should be enjoyable. If it's not a joyride, at least it
shouldn't be unpleasant.

- Your site should give something away. There are many ways to give something
valuable to your visitors without giving away the store.

- Design your site with the search engines in mind or you won't get many
visitors

That's all for today, and let's discuss later. Wish you success, I admire your
wit and courage.

Peter
