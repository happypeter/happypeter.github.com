## Synopsis
As a long time English learner, here I am trying to give you what as I
see is the right way to learn English Language.
For me the only right way to learn a foreign language is to do it the
same way you learn your birth tongue. That is, try to use it in your
life and work. 

## Intended Audience
This HOWTO is not for native English speakers, since we are only
concentrate on how to master basic English skills, like how to express
yourself simply, naturally, which is what all native
speakers already good at.

And if you live in Europe, you may also find this article is not so
useful. I have many European friends, all of them speaks very
good English, and I do not think they need to study really hard to be
that way, because in Europe, people knows the right way to learn
English, and they are doing it well.

But things are definitely not true in Asia, and to be more trustworthy
I would like to talk about only the situation in China. Everybody is spending lots of
time studying, but most people are in the wrong way. That's why I feel
this HOWTO might be of some meaning.

Again, I am not giving the suggestions to my fellow citizens whose
major is English. And my viewpoint here will not work well,  if you
are siting for a English level exam and want to improve your English
in short time. Rather, the intended audience would be people like
me who need to use English in daily work, but do not really have
full time to study it. And the people who want to explore the western
culture and already determined to be a life long English Learner. Or,
college students who need to take CET-4(College English Test band-4,
it sucks!), but are still one year or two before that.

## About  Grammar 
I am never interested in learning grammar, it is not because I do not want to 
write sentences formally and rightly, but rather that it is tooo
difficult to do so. Grammar is, as they, there is one rule
and 1000 exceptions will come with it. I tried to learn it, but failed
terribly.

Too much concern on grammar makes learning so
boring and using English so painful. The middle school exams hold a
high priority for grammar, that is why I hated the exams with all my
passion. But you know what? I ended up being a not-so-bad grammar guy
in my class, I should insist I never tried to learn, I just got there
by reading enough right sentences, I read lots of books. I do not want
to be egoistic and do show-off, I just want to conclude from my own
pain and experience:

__you do not need to learn grammar, it will comes to you when you've
read enough right sentences__ 

## What is good English?
The topic seems a little obscure, I know that. Here I only focus on
Chinese English learners, for whom English is a foreign language. I
want to start by giving my believe that it is basically impossible to
learn perfect English without staying in a English-speaking country
for more than 10 years. 

Here the word "perfect" means "not obviously different
from native speakers". No body speaks a language perfectly, many native
speaker speak very bad grammar, which makes their better educated
fellow citizen angry since they taint the language of Shakespeare, and
make me happy, since I can do better:-) However, even these guys
speaks better English than that of a Chinese English
Professor. Because by my definition, having good English means you can
wrap your mind easily to express your emotion clearly and telling
things clearly. Language is just a tool, a good tool shall be
something with which you can create things neither useful or
beautiful efficiently. As to grammars and other superficial stuff, I
beg to say they are only secondary. And that is one of the main
reasons I stick to the point that 

## English can only be learned in practical use.     
Well, I actually started to study this language in 1995, the first
year of my junior middle school. But it was merely 3 years ago that I
started to really using it. I do not want to wear your patience out by
telling a lot of my personal stories, but I want to tell you why I did
such a switch since I believe many people has such kind of dilemma.

I has always been a idiot who leads very simple life by doing whatever
I like, and I felt kind of free this way during my under gradate life,
that was 2001~2005, so I just love reading books in English, and I
spent nearly all my time learning English, and I loved it. But things
changed with the time passing by, and I eventually need to find a way
to make a living, that why I started programming since the first year
of my post graduate study. It was not so bad, coding was also
interesting. But one year later, that was the winter of 2007, I felt I
had been kept really busy for programming and I did not have enough time
for English study.    

## The wrong way to learn
In all my six years middle school life, everybody in my class tried
really hard to learn English, and me as no exception. But I really
hated it, English study is so boring

I think that is because:

## Examinations are Evil

It is worse than bad, it is evil. The more attention you put into exams, the less likely you can speak English well.

## conclusion

Forget about exams, go explore new world with English, reading English books,
taking notes in English. Trust me, I tried, and it worked.
